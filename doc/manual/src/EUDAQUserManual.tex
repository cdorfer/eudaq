\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document provides an overview of the EUDAQ software,
the data acquisition framework used by the EUDET JRA1 beam telescope.
It describes how to install and run the DAQ system and use many of the included utility programs,
and how users may integrate their systems into the EUDAQ framework
by writing their own Producer and DataConverterPlugin,
thus allowing them to take advantage of the EUTelescope analysis framework.
